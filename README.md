# security-audit
This project is used for practicing security audit on a contract intentially coded with security vunerabilities.

## BadKickback
The purpose of the contract, BadKickback, is used to encourage higher event turnout rate. The rule is to charge everyone a small fee when they sign up for the event. The fee will be refunded after the event check-in. No-shows will lose their fee, which will be split amongst the attendees.

## Task
Perform a security audit on the contract. Document in a report all the issues/vulnerabilities, classify their severities and provide recommendations.
